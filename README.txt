This is the JS port of the Fuzzy Set Affinity visualizer I created in C#.

The user flow is the following:
1) user lands on the webpage and is greeted with the option to either load the example or load their own file.
1b) either way the system will load a data file, change views, and pass along a json object to the visualization system
2) the visualization page will be an HTML 5 canvas that is the whole of the visualization.

the system will use JQuery and Twitter Bootstrap to get started, Jasmine to test.  We'll see what the future holds.
